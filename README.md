# runs expectancy matrix

To create run expectancy matrix (based on base-out states), run 000_libraries.R and then 001_ingest.R.
In 000_libraries.R, create your own working directory instead of using:
setwd("C:/Users/ethompson/Desktop/baseball")

Read the notes at the top of 001_ingest.R carefully.  Before running that script you will need to run the BEVENT.exe 
application using the Windows command prompt.  This creates the data file that 001_ingest.R consumes and manipulates.
