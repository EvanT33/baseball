# runs expectancy matrix

To create run expectancy matrix (based on base-out states), run 000_libraries.R and then 001_ingest.R.
Instead of using:
setwd("C:/Users/ethompson/Desktop/baseball")
create your own working directory.  

Read the notes at the top of 001_ingest.R carefully.  You'll see that before running that R script, you
will need to run the BEVENT program first using the Windows command prompt.  This creates the data file 
that the R script manipulates.
